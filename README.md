# 🧠 Reality Log: The Master Branch

> "Keeping up with reality, one commit at a time."

## Overview
This repository serves as the central log for schedules, inventory, project tracking, and daily operations. It acts as a static blog and a database for the development of our products and life management.

Maintained by **Cassandro** (The Typist/Dev) and the **Principal** (You).

## Structure
We utilize a Jekyll-compatible structure for easy rendering via GitHub Pages.

- **`_posts/`**: Daily logs, meeting notes, and stream-of-consciousness updates.
- **`catalog/`**: Dedicated product definitions, pricing, and specs.
- **`schedules/`**: Time-blocking and calendar events.

## Current Focus
- 📦 **Product Catalog Assembly** (Forma Series, Signage, Tech Accessories)
- 🗓️ **Scheduling & Logistics**

## Commit Message Convention
- `feat`: New items, new days, or new projects.
- `update`: Changes to existing schedules or lists.
- `fix`: Corrections to logs or pricing.
- `log`: Stream of consciousness or quick notes.
